    challenge: "Many cultural projects in Indonesia only focus on 'introducing' culture to young generations, but they rarely create something sustainable that can truly be passed on.",
    solution: "That’s why we built Leluri as a digital cultural community platform. Here, artisans, studios, young people, and culture lovers can talk, learn, collaborate, and even build a marketplace.",

    challenge: "Cultural tourism in Indonesia is often overlooked—even by Indonesians themselves. Tickets for festivals or attractions are hard to find, and big e-commerce platforms don’t really sell them. This makes culture harder to access and enjoy.",
    solution: "Tapaknusa was created as a dedicated e-commerce platform for cultural attractions and festivals. With a responsive and user-friendly design, it lets people easily explore and buy tickets online. The goal is to make discovering and enjoying culture as simple as buying anything else online.",

    techStack: ["Next.js","Node.js","Flask","Python","Random Forest","Mapbox API","OpenWeatherAPI","EOSDA API","Docker"],
    challenge: "Many small farmers in Indonesia can’t afford modern irrigation systems like drip irrigation, which makes it hard to manage water effectively. This leaves them at a disadvantage compared to larger farms.",
    solution: "We built Irrigo, a web app that gives farmers affordable irrigation guidance. Using soil moisture and local weather data, combined with a Random Forest AI model, it predicts water needs for the next five days. The app turns complex data into simple advice, helping farmers save water and grow better crops.",
