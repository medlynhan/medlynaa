    challenge: "Many cultural projects in Indonesia only focus on 'introducing' culture to young generations, but they rarely create something sustainable that can truly be passed on.",
    solution: "Leluri was developed as a digital cultural community platform, providing a space for artisans, studios, young people, and culture lovers to connect, learn, collaborate, and even create a marketplace. Cultural heritage cannot be preserved by study alone—it must remain a shared and continuous conversation.",

    challenge: "Cultural tourism in Indonesia is often overlooked—even by Indonesians themselves. Tickets for festivals or attractions are hard to find, and big e-commerce platforms don’t really sell them. This makes culture harder to access and enjoy.",
    solution: "Tapaknusa was created as a dedicated e-commerce platform for cultural attractions and festivals. With a responsive and user-friendly design, it lets people easily explore and buy tickets online. The goal is to make discovering and enjoying culture as simple as buying anything else online.",

    challenge: "Many small farmers in Indonesia can’t afford modern irrigation systems like drip irrigation, which makes it hard to manage water effectively. This leaves them at a disadvantage compared to larger farms.",
    solution: "Irrigo is a web app that provides farmers with affordable irrigation guidance. By using soil moisture and local weather data combined with a Random Forest AI model, it predicts water needs for the next five days. The app simplifies complex data into clear advice, helping farmers save water and grow healthier crops.",
